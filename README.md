### Description
AutoHosts is a automatically hosts file changer. It exploits the hosts file to help you bypass or penetrate the Great Fire Wall (GFW) censorship in mainland China. Please carefully read the NOTE below before using it.
This app is not perfectly polished, if you have any complaints, please directly contact me.

Here I must express my special gratitude to Bert Cotton, who helped me to remove the dependencies of busybox as well as UI tweak and async tasking.

Thanks for Kelvin Pan, who provides and maintains a reliable hosts for this app.
Hope one day we can have a accessible Internet in China.
